## :wave: Hi there! Adam Cook (he/him) here.

:factory: My career experience is primarily in designing, building and programming production machinery, industrial automation, manufacturing floors and custom robotics.

:gear: I am a former machinist. I worked on many floors around Northwest Indiana and South Chicago back in the day.

I am a [Purdue Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr) graduate.

I live in **Detroit**, The Comeback City!

:books: **These days, I am mostly working on and researching:**

* Hard real-time operating systems
* Computer-aided engineering technologies
* Software-based PLC and CNC platforms
* Machine Learning for manufacturing
* Interactive, web-based technical education

:computer: **Favorite and most frequently used programming languages:**

* Rust
* Python
* TypeScript
* C#
* C/C++
* Go

:zap: Fun fact: My first hobby programming language was [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic). My first professional programming language was [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)).

I recently became a collaborator for the [Built In Detroit](https://builtindetroit.today) project - an ambitious effort to create open and accessible engineering and manufacturing educational experiences and resources.

:artificial_satellite: **I am generally hanging out on:**
